# SSMSExecutor Installer

Installers & Instructions for installing SSMS Executor

##	Background

Microsoft’s SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) does a good job, but it lacks one tremendously useful feature: the ability to run a single statement at a time. (Sure, you can highlight the statement and run the selection, but who wants to do that multiple times?)

SSMS Executor ( [https://github.com/devvcat/ssms-executor](https://github.com/devvcat/ssms-executor) ) is a free addon which can be used to add this feature to SSMS.

Sadly, this addon hasn’t been updated for some time:

-	The original installer doesn’t work with newer versions of SSMS
-	The original addon no longer works with the SSMS version 21.

An updated version of SSMS is available from [https://github.com/tkwj/ssms-executor](https://github.com/tkwj/ssms-executor) .

When it comes to an updated installer, here it is.

Here are three methods to install SSMSExecutor, in order of convenience:

-	Run the SSMSExecutorInstaller application.
-	Run the SSMSExecutorInstaller batch script.
-	Copy the files manually.
